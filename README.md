# Data-Science-Clustering-Project

Simple demo of customer segmentation concepts(market basket analysis) using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm)


we have some basic data about our customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.


Problem:
I want to understand who are our likely Target Customers(easy to convert) are so that the marketing team can plan a strategy based on this.

Project is still in progress, I would try to solve this with other ML algorithms and also measure use different metrics to measure them
